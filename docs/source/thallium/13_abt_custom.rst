Custom schedulers and pools
===========================

Argobots enables you to define custom pools and schedulers.
Thallium wraps this feature and makes it object oriented.
The best way to define a custom pool and a custom scheduler
is to look at the following example.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/thallium/13_abt_custom/main.cpp
       :language: cpp
